# EBML Parser

This [EBML](http://ebml.sourceforge.net/) parser is designed to parse EBML fragments that are already fully loaded and available in an ArrayBuffer. Parsing of incomplete streams is not supported.

EBML is used as the storage layer for a number of different file formats, such as MKV and WebM.
